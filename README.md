- 👋 Hi, I’m @JenniYr also known as Jenni Yrjänä
- 👀 I’m interested in Java and JavaScript programming. I also want to work with healthcare assosiated applications in future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript. Now I know why it is one of the most popular programming languages. I've got some IoT-courses going at the moment. I'm also planning to get to familiar with NoSQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software companies somewhere near Kalajoki. But I'm also interested in for example Oulu, Kokkola, Ylivieska, Tampere and Seinäjoki if working remote is an option.
